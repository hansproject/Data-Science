# Data-Science

This data science has 2 projects. 

- The first and most consistent is about 2016 US  presidential. Is it possible to predict the result of election using previous ones?

- The second is a sample file I downloaded called officesupplies from superdatascience.com that contains customers of a bank coming from different countries and sorted based on gender. 
My goal was to see if a male is more likely to live than a female customer.
I used AB test to quickly if it is correct, then I used the chi squared square to confirm the importance of the gender. 
I applied the chi square test with 5 percent significance level on the total number of records sorted based on the gender, isExited or stayed(a customer) on this website: http://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/chisquare/Default2.aspx
I dragged on the first and first column male customers that stayed, the first column second row the female customers that stayed. Then first row second column male customers that exited and second row second column female customer that exited.
The conclusion is that the probality that a customer leave depends on his gender.
