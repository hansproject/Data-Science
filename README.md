## Data-Science

This data science has several projects. 
- The first is about predicting whether a customer of bank will exit it or not based Credit Score, Number of Products used and several other variables. This project use RandomForest regression to predict on a test dataset.
- The second one is a Google stock price predictive model. The model will try to predict the highest price for the next 20 days of the stock after training.
- The third is a sample file I downloaded called officesupplies from superdatascience.com that contains customers of a bank coming from different countries and sorted based on gender. 
My goal was to see if a male is more likely to live than a female customer.
I used AB test to quickly if it is correct, then I used the chi squared square to confirm the importance of the gender. 
I applied the chi square test with 5 percent significance level on the total number of records sorted based on the gender, isExited or stayed(a customer) on this website: http://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/chisquare/Default2.aspx
I dragged on the first and first column male customers that stayed, the first column second row the female customers that stayed. Then first row second column male customers that exited and second row second column female customer that exited.
The conclusion is that the probality that a customer leave depends on his gender.

- Last one is the code of a facebook bot that login in automatically into an account. But this code can be adapted transform into a tweeter or instagram bot.
